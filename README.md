# Cerberus
Security system mobile app implemented using Raspberry Pi and Django

## About
Cerberus is a security system running on a Raspberry Pi with a Python-based Django backend and user accessibility from an Android mobile app. The system is capable of detecting motion and sending push notifications to the user upon detection, as well as displaying video and 2-way audio. The purpose of this project was to deepen my understanding of Django and Android app development by creating a security system similar to those already on the market, such as Nest and Ring. The scope of this project covers setting up a Raspberry Pi to run a Django and Mumble server and other peripherals, as well as the source code for the mobile app. A large portion of the app was made using the source code of the Plumble app found here https://github.com/acomminos/Plumble and here https://github.com/acomminos/Jumble and was heavily editted to suit the needs of this project.
